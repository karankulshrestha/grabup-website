        Grabup offers a platform for scrap buyers to locate scrap that is for
        sale based on location. For commodities like aluminium, plastic, and
        other scraps to be sold directly to manufacturers, people put scrap for
        sale, and we collect the information and create a way for scrap
        merchants. As a result, we disrupt the system and boost revenue for the
        businesses who buy, sell, and recycle the finished goods.
